# Hostel-Reservation-System
A comprehensive hotel reservation system developed with JavaFX.
An Hotel Reservation System.

The purpose of this application is to simulate the management of a hotel reservation system.
Through this application, the administrator can create, edit, and delete rooms, customers, services, and reservations. 
They can assign guests to rooms and manage check-in/check-out processes. The number of rooms is controlled, decreasing with each reservation and increasing when a reservation is deleted.

The system operates as follows:
a customer who registers at the hotel can be placed in any available room and can benefit from the services offered by the hotel.
When the customer checks out, the reservation can be deleted, or if requested, the customer record can be retained in the hotel's records.
When a customer checks out, the total amount to be paid, including the room charge (number of nights stayed * room price) and the total cost of services received,
can be calculated, resulting in the total amount the customer needs to pay.
